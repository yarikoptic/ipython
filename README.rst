===========================================
 IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
===========================================

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation, including PDF versions of our
manual, is available on `our website <http://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_;
if you downloaded a built source distribution the ``docs/html`` directory
contains an HTML version of the manual.  The ``docs/source`` directory contains
the plaintext version of these manuals.


Dependencies and supported Python versions
==========================================

For full details, see the installation section of the manual.  The basic parts
of IPython only need the Python standard library, but much of its more advanced
functionality requires extra packages.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.1 and above.

    
Instant running
===============

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal::

   $ python ipython.py
